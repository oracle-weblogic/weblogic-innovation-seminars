  <title>Getting Started With WInS</title>
</head>

<body>

NOTE: This page is currently under development.  We will have a final version for the 12.1.3 WINS VBOX release.

To get started, open a terminal window and do the following:

<ol>
  <li>cd $DEMOS_HOME</li>
  <li>./initialize.sh</li>
  <li>Open FireFox, which will open the WInS Webapp as the homepage</li>
</ol>

The initialize.sh script will compile all the code, create the necessary
WebLogic domains and deploy the example applications.  This is a one-time setup setp and
will take 12-25 mintues depending on the speed of your machine.  If you manage to get things into a non-working
state you can also run the initialize.sh script which should clear out the domains and recompile the apps.

Demo guides can be found under $DEMOS_HOME/doc/demo-guides.  They are in the process of being placed there.  In the
meantime please find the
